# Meganote
A full-stack note-taking app that supports multiple users. Its server is the [`meganote-server`] (https://github.com/Bovojon/meganote-server).  

> **Note:** This is the front end. For the corresponding API, see the [`meganote-server`] (https://github.com/Bovojon/meganote-server).  

## Technical Overview

* AngularJS 1.x
* UI Router

In development:
* ECMAScript 2016 (ES6)
* NPM - development dependencies 
* Gulp - to build the system
* Babel - to convert ES6 to ES5

## Getting Started

> Meganote uses NPM to manage development dependencies, so install Node if necessary.

To get started, clone the repository, and run `npm start`.

```shell
git clone <this repo>
cd <this project folder>
npm start
```

This will start a web server on port 8000. 

## Deployment 

To deploy Meganote, copy the `app` folder, including `bower components` subfolder (which is not included in the repo) to your remote server.
